# Simple Text Encryption CLI Tool

---

## Description
_This tool is a simple CLI tool that encrypts and decrypts text using a simple substitution cipher.
The cipher is a simple substitution cipher that uses a 26 character alphabet.
The alphabet is shuffled and then used to encrypt the text._

I wrote this just to learn java and make basic CLI tools to handle cli arguments and file input/output.

### _**THE CIPHER IS NOT SECURE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR SENSITIVE INFORMATION.**_
